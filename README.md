Version 2 Rewrite of ColonelBot for the N1 Grand Prix Discord community.

#Introduction
ColonelBot is a Discord Bot designed to cater to the needs of the N1 Grand Prix Discord Community, providing useful information, event tools, moderation support, and more.  This second version is a complete ground-up rewrite of the original version based on feedback and new techniques learned.  

#Features
- Event Tools: Provides a way for authorized Event Organizers to create, manage, and host events. This allows users to register for an active event and quickly obtain information surrounding it.
- Automoderation: If enabled, works off of a phrase blacklist/whitelist system to report instances and locations of phrases. Also supports autodeletion of said phrases.
- Information: Quick access to community-built guides and connectivity requirements for MMBN6 Netbattling.
- Memes: A Discord Bot is nothing without community-sourced memes.

#Planned Features
- Robust Quote Engine: Quotes occur at a moment's notice. When invoked, they are situationally the funniest memes, especially without context.  
- Reddit Feeds: Reporting of Reddit Feeds (new) to a specified chat channel.
- Youtube Integration: nice meme
- Expanded Event Tools: Leveraging Challonge's API, ColonelBot will be able to dynamically create events, add registrants, drop them, call out matches, and accept scorekeeping synchronously with Challonge's website.
- Audio Memes: someone please help oh god why is this so difficult 
- Program Advance + Battlechip Lookup: Legacy Feature allowing users to look up Battlechip data and Program Advance data at-a-glance right from Discord.
- Twitch Integration: A Server owner or authorized user can activate a Twitch Mode, tying ColonelBot to a Twitch Chat that provides identical information via commands as a user in Discord would.

#Future
Future revisions of ColonelBot will transition to the 1.0 version of Discord API after the modules are completed for v2.  

Please reach out to me on Twitter if you have any questions or problems.  Version 2 supports multiple servers at this time.
